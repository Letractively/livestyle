  # Add a reference to the LiveStyle DLL from your ASP.NET web project.
  # Add this handler to your web.config `<add verb="*" path="LiveStyle.ashx" type="LiveStyle.LiveStyleHandler, LiveStyle"/>`
  # Run your web site
  # Navigate to `/livestyle.ashx?install`
  # Add the Live Style bookmarklet to your favorites/bookmarks (using the right click menu usually)

Now when on a page in your site, run the bookmarklet. This injects a script into your page and opens the Live Style editor window.

You will probably need to disable your pop-up blocker temporarily.
